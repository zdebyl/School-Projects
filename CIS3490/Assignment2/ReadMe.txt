To compile and run Q1:
make
./q1

- this will run both brute force and recursive algorithm (first brute then recursive)

To compile and run Q2:
make
./q2

- this will run brute algorithm and shortest path then recursive algorithm and shortest path
- when promted to enter points, enter the x value then the y value separated by a space
- points are printed during the program once a convex hull point is found
- convex hull points are also printed after the program is done running using the results from the function

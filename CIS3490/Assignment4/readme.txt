To compile and run Q1 (1.1 and 1.2):
make
./q1

- this will run both dynamic programming algorithm and greedy technique algorithm
- first, dynamic algorithm will run and you will be prompted to enter a key to search the optimal binary search tree
  created from the dynamic algorithm
- then, greedy algorithm will run and you will be prompted to enter a key to search the optimal binary search tree
  created from the greedy algorithm

To compile and run Q2:
make
./q2

- this will prompt you for a file name, then run the Gale-Shapley algorithm and output the matches in a matrix
